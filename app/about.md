Jekyll Polymer is a template to build a static blog website using Google's Polymer libraries with Jekyll. It currently uses Polymer 1.x, but I plan to update it to Jekyll 2.x in the near future.

 This template provides numerous features to make it a full-featured mobile-first blogging template. It has full-text search, tag support and tagged archive, threaded comments with Disqus, and an RSS feed. All while doing its best to adhere to the ever-changing target of Google's material design specifications! Check out some of the posts and other pages in this demo to see the features and styling of the posts.

I have been working on this in my spare time, and I appreciate any feedback or requests to improve the project better. You can see more about this project on its [Github repository](https://github.com/jtebert/jekyll-polymer).
